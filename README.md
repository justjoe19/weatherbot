# Weatherbot

This python program uses APIs from OpenWeatherMap and X.com (formerly Twitter) to automatically 
tweet a weather forecast message at designated intervals throughout the day and night. 

Any location can be used, but it is written using South Bend, Indiana as the location.

Weatherbot is currently active @SBforecast on X.com
